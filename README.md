# Nigeria-COVID-19-Real-Time-Data-Analysis-Using-Python

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, and it has affected major parts of the world. Nigeria, a West-African country, has also been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic after recording its first case on 27th February 2020.

Nigeria is a country with 37 states - Federal Capital Territory included- and a fast-growing economic environment with about 200 million citizens. COVID-19 has affected several country activities as the country steadily progressed from its first case to shutting down major airports, state-wide lockdown, curfews, and reviving its economy.

The goal of this project is to answer real-world questions by considering an in-depth analytical approach.

In this project, i employ data science & analytics skills to collect data from different source such as NCDC, JOHN HOPKINS, EXTERNAL DATA etc, combining and exploring the data, perform analysis, create visualizations, and generate insights on Nigeria covid'19 pandemic.
